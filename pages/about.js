          About Me
        </h1>
        <div>
          <p className="mb-4">
            I'm all about creating awesome tech solutions - it's not just my job, it's my
            passion. Ever since my teenage years, when I was playing around with Myspace,
            coding has been a lifelong love affair for me. I remember taking apart my
            Playstations and laptops as a kid, just to see how they worked. That tinkering
            bug never left me (although I can't say the same for my poor game systems!)

          My Education
        </h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            My journey started in the Electrical Engineering Technology program at
            Georgian College, I knew growing up I always wanted to work with technology,
            although I wasn&apos;t sure what aspect I wanted to pursue (hardware,
            software, robotics, etc.). It was in my third year that I started programming
            in my PLC class. I started by programming and connecting a Raspberry Pi to a
            live circuit. When I saw my code being translated to physical movements, I
            knew this was the right fit for me. From that day onward I knew I wanted to be
            a programmer.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p className="mb-4">
            In 2019, I decided to pursue a formal education in web development at Juno
            College of Technology (formerly HackerYou), where I completed the Web
            Development Immersive bootcamp. This gave me all the tools necessary to become
            a Front End developer.

          Where I&apos;ve Worked
        </h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            I have 2.5 years of professional experience as a Front End Developer. My main
            focus has been component driven development. Primarily working in Next.js,
            React, Tailwind and ScSS. In my short time on this adventure, I&apos;ve
            already contributed to over a dozen large scale projects. I have taken on
            freelance opportunities where I have not only been the lead developer on these
            projects (teams of up to 3), but also managed all communications between
            myself and the clients. This includes drafting all the contracts and have been
            the main point of contact for any of their needs.
